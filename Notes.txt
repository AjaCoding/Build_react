Building my own React.js. 
A declarative UI framework with virtual DOM reconciliation and hook-based state management. 

project review: 
Architecture diagram

Performance comparisons

Design tradeoffs

“What I’d do differently next”

Phase 0: 
Skills to be comfortable with

JavaScript (ES6+)

Closures, immutability

DOM APIs

Functional programming basics

Data structures (trees)

Key ideas to review

How the browser renders DOM

Why DOM updates are expensive

Why frameworks exist

📌 Deliverable: You can manually create and update 
    DOM nodes and understand why batching matters.

Phase 1: Create a Minimal Renderer (Week 1)
Goal

Render UI from plain JS objects instead of HTML.
Tasks

Define a createElement function

Convert object → real DOM

Append to root container

Skills learned

Declarative UI

Tree traversal

DOM manipulation

📌 Milestone: You can render a static UI without touching HTML.

Phase 2: Components & Composition (Week 2)
Goal

Support functions as components
like: function Hello(props) {
  return createElement("h1", {}, `Hello ${props.name}`);
}

Tasks

Detect when type is a function

Call it to produce child elements

Allow nested components

Concepts

Component trees

Pure functions

Props

📌 Milestone: Components can call components.

Phase 3: Virtual DOM & Diffing (Weeks 3–4)
Goal

Update only what changed.

Tasks

Store previous virtual tree

Compare old vs new tree

Generate minimal DOM operations

Diffing basics

Same node type → update props

Different type → replace node

Recurse on children

Skills learned

Tree diff algorithms

Performance optimization

Structural sharing

📌 This alone is already a strong portfolio project

Phase 4: State Management (Weeks 5–6)
Goal

Allow components to re-render based on state changes.

Minimal API
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

Start simpler:

Global state store

Component-local state map

Re-render entire tree on state change

Then improve:

Only re-render affected subtree

Preserve state between renders

Concepts

Closures

Referential identity

Render scheduling

📌 Milestone: Clicking a button updates the UI declaratively.

Phase 5: Event System (Week 7)
Goal

Handle events efficiently.

Tasks

Attach event handlers via props

Normalize events

Optional: event delegation

Skills learned

Browser event model

Synthetic events

Memory optimization

Phase 6: Hooks & Lifecycle (Weeks 8–9)
Goal

Generalize state and effects.

Implement:

useState

useEffect (basic)

Dependency tracking

Concepts

Call order invariants

Side-effect scheduling

Cleanup handling

📌 This is where things feel “React-ish”

Phase 7: JSX (Optional, Weeks 10–11)
Goal

Developer ergonomics.

Tasks

Use Babel to transform JSX → createElement

Build your own JSX pragma

/** @jsx MyReact.createElement */

Skills learned

Tooling

AST transforms

Build pipelines

Phase 8: Performance and Architecture (optional improvement)
